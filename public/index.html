          This home page is an evolving page created by Michael A Sawyer.
          It is a test bed for learning Angular.js and Single Page Applications
          in general. More content to come soon including a Ruby on Rails
          application that also leverages Angular. Soon to come is a dynamic app
          in development for a relative's wedding.

        <h2>Word Ladder</h2>
        The word ladder is a game in which you try to step from a begin goal,
        to an end goal by changing each word in between by only one letter.

        <h2>Image Social Media</h2>
        The Image Social Media Site assignment was to create a social media
        site, where users could upload images and share them with specific
        users, or, allow public access to the image.<br>
        This project featured many-to-many relationships, as well as the ability
        to upload images as well as gifs.

        <h2>Quiz</h2>
        Quiz Helper was my final assignment. This was an open ended assignment
        designed to demonstrate our knowledge of Ruby on Rails. This project also
        featured many-to-many and one-to-many relationships.
